    <h2>What is the real name of Earth?</h2>

    <h2>Why is the earth called?</h2>
     <p> All of the planets, except for Earth, were named after Greek and Roman gods and godesses. The name Earth is an English/German name which simply means the ground. It comes from the Old English words 'eor(th)e' and 'ertha'.</p>
    <h2>What was Earth first called?</h2>
    <p>Similarly, the names Mother Earth and Mother Nature have roots in Greek mythology. Gaia was the Greek goddess of Earth who the ancient greeks believed "gave birth" to nature as she was the origin of all life. The Roman equivalent of Gaia was Terra Mater.</p>
    <h2>What is Earth made of?</h2>
     <p> The earth is made up of three different layers: the crust, the mantle and the core. This is the outside layer of the earth and is made of solid rock, mostly basalt and granite. There are two types of crust; oceanic and continental. Oceanic crust is denser and thinner and mainly composed of basalt.</p>
